# CB1.1-chatbot
CB1 is a beginner friendly chatbot I made using Python. It responds to user input using basic conditionals ('if', 'elif', 'else'). It's simple and not so smart, but I have an emotional attachment to it since it's my first ever 'proper' code. Please do not expect much and have fun!
## What It Does
- Takes user input
- Gives hardcoded responses
- Built with Python, and love 💅🏻

## 🛠 How to Run

1. Download `cb1.py`
2. Open your terminal (Mac users: press `Cmd + Space`, type “Terminal”)
3. Navigate to the folder where your file is:

```bash
cd path/to/your/folder
python3 cb1.py
